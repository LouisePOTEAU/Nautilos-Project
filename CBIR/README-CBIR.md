For the CBIR algorithm, execution requires two different folders:

> **DatabaseTot**:

  > **images**: Contains the images from which features will be extracted.

  > **labelTxt**: Contains the \textit{txt} files with information on the images.

  > **dataset**: This folder will be created automatically after the first use of the algorithm.

-> **Divides images**: Contains the different sections and a CSV file of the query image. This folder will also be created automatically after the first use of the algorithm.
